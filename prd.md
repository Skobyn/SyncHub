**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-15

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for the "GrocerySync Hub - Support Edition", a centralized platform designed for Point-of-Sale (POS) support companies. Its purpose is to streamline the management, execution, and monitoring of grocery item data exports from numerous, diverse client POS systems to various e-commerce platforms, improving efficiency for support technicians and reliability for end clients.

### 1.2. Goals
- **Efficiency:** Reduce the time and effort required for support technicians to configure, deploy, and troubleshoot data integrations for multiple clients.
- **Reliability:** Increase the success rate and consistency of data exports through automation and robust error handling.
- **Visibility:** Provide clear, real-time monitoring and historical reporting on integration status for both support techs and potentially administrators.
- **Scalability:** Build a system capable of handling hundreds of retail clients and agents simultaneously.
- **Flexibility:** Easily adapt to new POS systems and e-commerce platforms via a plugin architecture.
- **Security:** Ensure secure handling of client configurations, credentials, and data flow according to best practices.

### 1.3. Scope
This PRD covers the core features of the Central Hub web application and the associated Client Agent software. It includes requirements for multi-tenancy, agent communication, job configuration/scheduling, monitoring, logging, and the plugin architecture. Initial scope includes support for a defined set of common POS systems and destination platforms.

## 2. Users

- **Support Technician:** Primary user. Configures retailer setups, defines export jobs, monitors status, troubleshoots failures using the Central Hub UI. Requires an intuitive interface that handles complexity across many clients.
- **Support Administrator / Director:** Oversees the system. Manages technician user accounts and permissions, views aggregated reports, manages system-wide settings (e.g., plugins, global notifications).

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Central Hub Application
**3.1.1. User Authentication & Authorization**
    - Secure login for authorized support technicians.
    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): At minimum, distinct roles for Administrator (full access) and Technician (operational access, potentially restricted).
**3.1.2. Retailer Management (Multi-Tenant)**
    - Ability to Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) retailer profiles (e.g., Client Name, Unique ID, Basic Contact).
    - All data associated with a retailer (configurations, jobs, logs) must be strictly isolated and only accessible based on user permissions.
**3.1.3. Client Agent Management**
    - Generate unique, secure credentials (e.g., API Key/Secret pair) for each Client Agent instance during retailer setup.
    - Revoke agent credentials.
    - View agent connection status (Online, Offline, Last Heartbeat timestamp, Agent Version) per retailer.
**3.1.4. Destination Configuration (Per Retailer)**
    - CRUD operations for defining e-commerce destinations specific to a retailer.
    - Select Destination Type (e.g., Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, SFTP - driven by available plugins).
    - Configure destination-specific details (e.g., API Endpoint, API Key/Secret, SFTP Host/Port/User/Pass/Path). Secure storage of credentials (encrypted at rest).
    - Select Export Channel (API, SFTP - may be inherent to Destination Type).
    - Functionality to test the connection to the configured destination.
**3.1.5. POS Configuration (Per Retailer)**
    - Define the type(s) of POS system(s) present at the retailer's site (selected from available POS plugins). This informs the Agent which connector to use.
**3.1.6. Export Job Management (Per Retailer)**
    - CRUD operations for defining export jobs.
    - Associate a job with one retailer.
    - Assign a descriptive name.
    - Select Source (implicitly the retailer's POS via the Agent and specified POS plugin type).
    - Select Destination (choose from the retailer's configured destinations).
    - Define Job Schedule (Manual Only, Hourly, Daily @ HH:MM, Weekly on Day @ HH:MM, Custom Cron Expression).
    - Enable/Disable toggle for jobs.
    - Button to trigger an immediate ("Run Now") execution of the job.
    - Basic data filtering options (e.g., "Export only items updated since last successful run").
**3.1.7. Monitoring & Dashboards**
    - **Global Dashboard:** Overview across all managed retailers (e.g., map view of statuses, count of online/offline agents, count of recent job failures, system alerts).
    - **Retailer Dashboard:** View specific to one selected retailer (Agent status, recent job history/status for this client, quick links to config/logs).
**3.1.8. Logging & Reporting**
    - **Job Logs:** Centralized, searchable, and filterable view of all job execution records across all clients (Filter by: Retailer, Date Range, Job Name, Status [Success/Failure/Warning], POS Type, Destination Type). Drill-down to view detailed log messages for a specific job run.
    - **Agent Logs:** View logs related to agent connectivity and internal operations (per agent/retailer).
    - **Audit Trail:** Log significant actions performed by technicians within the Hub (e.g., user logins, config changes, job creation/deletion).
**3.1.9. Plugin Management (Admin)**
    - Interface for administrators to view currently installed/available POS Connector and Destination Adapter plugins.
    - (Future) Interface to upload/manage plugin packages.
**3.1.10. Notifications**
    - Configure rules to send notifications (e.g., email, webhook) on specific events (e.g., job failure for > X minutes, agent offline for > Y minutes). Can be global or potentially per-retailer overrides.

### 3.2. Client Agent Software
**3.2.1. Installation & Configuration**
    - Provide installer package (e.g., MSI for Windows).
    - Agent runs as a background Windows Service or Linux daemon.
    - Requires initial configuration upon install: Central Hub URL, unique Agent Credentials (API Key/Secret).
    - Loads local POS connection details securely (e.g., from a config file readable only by the service account).
**3.2.2. Secure Communication**
    - Initiates all connections **outbound** to the Central Hub API over HTTPS/TLS.
    - Authenticates to the Hub using its unique credentials on every request.
**3.2.3. Registration & Heartbeat**
    - Registers itself with the Hub upon first successful connection.
    - Sends periodic heartbeat/check-in signals to the Hub to indicate it's online and operational.
**3.2.4. Command & Configuration Handling**
    - Periodically polls the Hub for pending commands (e.g., "Run Job X", "Update Configuration") or maintains a persistent connection (e.g., WebSocket) for real-time commands.
    - Can receive updated configuration details from the Hub (e.g., new job schedules, updated destination credentials).
**3.2.5. Job Execution**
    - On receiving a "Run Job" command:
        - Retrieves full job details from the Hub (Source POS type, Destination details, filters).
        - Loads and utilizes the appropriate POS Connector plugin to fetch data from the local POS system.
        - Loads and utilizes the appropriate Destination Adapter plugin.
        - Connects directly to the target e-commerce platform/SFTP server using the provided credentials.
        - Transmits the data.
        - Handles errors during POS connection, data fetching, destination connection, or data upload.
**3.2.6. Status & Log Reporting**
    - Reports job execution status (Initiated, In Progress, Success, Failed, Warning) back to the Central Hub in near real-time.
    - Sends detailed execution logs (including specific error messages) back to the Central Hub.
    - Reports its own health status (e.g., connectivity issues, plugin loading errors) to the Hub.
**3.2.7. Plugin Utilization**
    - Ability to load and execute code based on the plugin type specified in job configurations (requires defined plugin interfaces and loading mechanism).

### 3.3. Plugin System
**3.3.1. Standardized Interfaces**
    - Define clear, versioned programming interfaces (e.g., abstract classes, interfaces in the agent's language) for:
        - POS Connectors (methods for connecting, fetching items based on criteria like timestamps or IDs, disconnecting).
        - Destination Adapters (methods for connecting, uploading data batches/items, disconnecting).
**3.3.2. Extensibility**
    - New POS systems or Destination platforms can be supported by creating new plugins implementing the standard interfaces, without requiring changes to the core Agent or Hub code.
    - Hub needs to be aware of available plugins to offer them in the UI.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Security
- All communication between Agent and Hub encrypted (HTTPS/TLS 1.2+).
- Secure storage of all credentials (Hub user passwords hashed, Agent keys, Destination API keys/passwords encrypted at rest).
- Role-based access control enforced consistently in the Hub.
- Strict multi-tenant data isolation in the Hub database and logic.
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10) for the Hub.
- Agent executable should be code-signed (optional but recommended).

### 4.2. Scalability
- Central Hub backend must be designed to handle concurrent connections and requests from hundreds or thousands of agents.
- Database schema and queries optimized for performance, especially log ingestion and reporting.
- Consider stateless Hub backend services suitable for horizontal scaling.
- Agent must have minimal CPU/Memory footprint on the client's machine.

### 4.3. Reliability & Availability
- Central Hub should aim for high availability (e.g., 99.9%).
- Agent must run reliably as a background service and restart automatically if it crashes (where possible via OS service management).
- Robust error handling in Agent job execution with clear reporting to Hub.
- Hub job scheduler must be reliable.
- Implement backup procedures for the Central Hub's database and configuration.

### 4.4. Usability (Hub UI)
- Intuitive navigation and clear layout.
- Easy configuration of retailers, destinations, and jobs.
- Clear visualization of system status, agent health, and job success/failure.
- Actionable error messages and easy access to relevant logs for troubleshooting.

### 4.5. Maintainability
- Modular codebase for Hub (backend/frontend) and Agent.
- Well-documented code, APIs, and plugin interfaces.
- Comprehensive logging throughout the system.
- Automated tests (unit, integration, potentially end-to-end for core flows).

### 4.6. Performance
- Hub UI should be responsive.
- API response times between Hub and Agent should be low.
- Job execution time should be reasonable (highly dependent on POS performance, data volume, and destination API limits).

## 5. Future Considerations
- Advanced graphical data mapping interface.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) command bar in Hub.
- Agent self-update mechanism triggered from the Hub.
- More sophisticated reporting and KPI dashboards.
- Support for job dependencies or chained workflows.
- Optional read-only dashboard view for end-clients (retailers).
- Support for different data formats (XML, JSON, etc.) beyond initial assumptions.
