# Progress: GrocerySync Hub - Support Edition

## What Works
- Memory Bank directory created and populated with planning.md and task.md.
- Core context files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md) drafted from PRD and planning documents.
- Django backend initialized in hub-backend/ (virtualenv, Django, DRF, psycopg2-binary installed).
- Backend README and root README updated with setup instructions and status.
- Initial models for Users, Retailers, Agents, Destinations, Jobs defined in core app.
- Custom user model configured in settings.
- Migrations created and applied.
- **Django REST Framework and token authentication endpoint enabled.**
- **API structure scaffolded (core/api_urls.py, backend URLs updated).**
- **Backend README updated with API/auth instructions.**
- **Memory Bank and task list aligned with PRD for next steps.**
- **Next.js frontend initialized in `hub-frontend/`.**
- **CORS enabled in backend for local frontend integration.**
- **Cloud Build configuration (`cloudbuild.yaml`) created for Docker build and Cloud Run deployment.**
- **All secrets (Django secret key, DB password, Google OAuth credentials) managed via Secret Manager and referenced in Cloud Build/Run.**
- **All non-secret env vars hardcoded in cloudbuild.yaml for reliability.**
- **Cloud SQL and GCS fully integrated.**
- **Initial deployment to Cloud Run successful.**

## What's Left
- Implement authentication and core API endpoints for Users, Retailers, Agents, Destinations, and Jobs, enforcing RBAC and multi-tenancy as per PRD.
- Verify Cloud Run service functionality and monitor logs.
- Update documentation and commit changes.
- Begin frontend setup.
- Implement features as per task list (authentication, RBAC, agent API, CRUD, plugin system, etc.).

## Overall Status
- Project setup, backend initialization, and core models complete. DRF and API structure in place. 
- **Backend deployed successfully to Cloud Run via Cloud Build.**
- **Secrets and non-secrets managed according to best practices.**
- Ready to begin authentication and API development (per PRD requirements).

## Known Issues
- None at this stage.
