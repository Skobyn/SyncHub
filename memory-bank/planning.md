# Planning: GrocerySync Hub - Support Edition

## 1. Project Vision
To create a centralized, multi-tenant platform enabling a Point-of-Sale (POS) support company to efficiently manage, monitor, and automate the export of grocery item data from hundreds of their retail clients' diverse POS systems to various e-commerce platforms.

## 2. Core User & Context
- **Primary Users:** Support Technicians at the POS support company.
- **Operational Context:** Managing integrations for hundreds of independent retail clients, each potentially using one of 4+ different POS systems. Technicians have temporary remote access to client systems, primarily for initial setup. The system must facilitate ongoing management and monitoring without requiring constant remote access.

## 3. Core Architecture: Hub-and-Agent Model
This architecture addresses the need for central management and avoids requiring inbound connections to numerous client networks.

- **Central Hub:**
    - A web application hosted securely by the support company (or their cloud provider).
    - Provides the management UI for support technicians.
    - Handles multi-tenant configuration (data segregated per retailer).
    - Orchestrates export jobs (schedules, triggers).
    - Aggregates status, logs, and reporting data from all agents.
    - Provides secure API endpoints for agent communication.
- **Client Agent:**
    - A lightweight software agent (service/daemon) installed on a suitable machine at each retail client's site (e.g., POS server, back-office PC).
    - Initiates secure **outbound** connections to the Central Hub API.
    - Receives configuration and job commands from the Hub.
    - Interacts directly with the **local** POS system using specific plugins.
    * Transmits data **directly** to the target e-commerce platform (API, SFTP) using specific plugins and credentials stored centrally (or securely configured).
    - Reports status, logs, and results back to the Central Hub.

## 4. Key Features & Requirements Outline
- **Centralized Management:** Single interface for techs to manage all clients.
- **Multi-Tenancy:** Strict data isolation between retailers within the Hub.
- **Secure Outbound Communication:** Agents connect out to the Hub (HTTPS/TLS).
- **Extensibility:** Plugin-based system for POS connectors and E-commerce destination adapters.
- **Per-Client Configuration:** Manage POS types, destinations, and export jobs specifically for each retailer.
- **Job Scheduling & Orchestration:** Define schedules (manual, time-based) in the Hub; agents execute.
- **Monitoring & Reporting:** Global dashboard, per-client dashboards, aggregated/filterable logs, agent status tracking.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Different permission levels for support technicians/administrators within the Hub.
- **Robustness:** Error handling, retries, Hub configuration backup, data retention policies for logs.

## 5. Technology Constraints & Preferences (Initial - Subject to Refinement)
- **Hub:** Web-based UI, scalable backend technology (e.g., Python/Node.js/Java/.NET), relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- **Agent:** Cross-platform compatibility desirable, but Windows is primary target. Lightweight runtime (e.g., Go, .NET Core potentially suitable). Must run as a background service.
- **Communication:** Secure API (RESTful or similar over HTTPS).
- **Plugins:** Clearly defined interfaces; mechanism for agent to utilize plugins (e.g., pre-bundled or dynamically loaded).

## 6. Future Goals
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) interface for commands within the Hub.
- Advanced graphical data mapping UI.
- Agent self-update capability.
- More detailed KPI reporting.

## 7. LLM Context Note
This plan outlines the core system architecture and goals. Development should adhere to the Hub-and-Agent model described. Key considerations are multi-tenancy, security (especially agent communication and credential handling), scalability, and usability for support technicians managing numerous clients remotely. Focus initial efforts on establishing the core communication, configuration, and monitoring loop.
