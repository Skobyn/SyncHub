# Project Brief: GrocerySync Hub - Support Edition

## Purpose
A centralized platform for POS support companies to manage, execute, and monitor grocery item data exports from diverse client POS systems to various e-commerce platforms. The system aims to streamline support technician workflows, improve reliability, and provide robust monitoring and reporting.

## Goals
- Efficiency: Reduce technician effort for configuration, deployment, and troubleshooting.
- Reliability: Automate and standardize data exports with robust error handling.
- Visibility: Real-time and historical monitoring for support staff and admins.
- Scalability: Support hundreds of retail clients and agents.
- Flexibility: Adapt to new POS and e-commerce platforms via plugins.
- Security: Secure handling of credentials, configs, and data.

## Scope
- Central Hub web application (multi-tenant, RBAC, dashboards, job management, logging, plugin management).
- Client Agent software (secure outbound comms, plugin-based POS/data export, status/log reporting).
- Plugin system for POS connectors and destination adapters.
- Initial support for CSV-to-SFTP export as MVP.

## Out of Scope (for MVP)
- Advanced data mapping UI
- NLP command bar
- Agent self-update
- End-client dashboard
- Chained job dependencies

## High-Level Requirements
- Multi-tenancy, RBAC, secure API, plugin architecture, monitoring, logging, error handling, and extensibility.
